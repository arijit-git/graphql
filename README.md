# graphql

GraphQL was built with the idea that a client can request a certain amount of data and get just that data and no more, no less. It meant that now APIs became future-proof because they could build endpoints that provided all the information people could possibly need. And if the client didn't need all that, they didn't get all that. GraphQL was made open source in 2015, and it's slowly become a very, very popular thing in the ecosystem across a number of different languages and technologies and for a simple reason. It's dedicated to just solving the problem.
